Next Steps:

1. npm install react react-dom react-scripts react-router-dom
2. npm run build
3. npm run start:dev

Notes: 
    - index.js is importing useEffect and useState because these are commonly used,
    especially when working with APIs
    - index.js is importing React Router as well, may not be needed (?)
